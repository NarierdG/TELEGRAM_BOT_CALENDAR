**HI, human!**

I would like write telegram-bot on Python.
And I decided to try it. 

**Functional:**
1. Add reminder:
   - Creating and Describing a Reminder.
2. Change of reminder:
   - There are no words necessary here.
3. Today's plans:
   - Shows all the plans for today.
4. All plans:
   - Shows all upcoming plans.
